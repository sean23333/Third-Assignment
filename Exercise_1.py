'''
Write a function that takes as arguments a numpy array, v and a tuple of two numbers a and b (with b >= a).
the function will return a Numpy array that contains all the values in v that are in the interval [a,b] (notice the inclusion).

example: input1 = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6]), input2 = (1,5), output = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
Provide examples to showcase that the functions works.
